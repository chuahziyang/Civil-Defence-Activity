        Don’t drop your “phishing antenna” just because you see a familiar
        person as the sender of an email. Keep looking for anything suspicious
        that could indicate the message isn’t from the person or company it
        appears to be. Common indicators of a fake: - The email doesn’t make
        sense to you (i.e., it’s strange that your friend would send this)
        Spelling or grammar errors - No explanation or normal greeting, just a
        sentence or two with a link to click. - The email is unexpected It’s
        always best to contact the person/company the email is purporting to be
        from when in doubt. For example, call your friend or call the company
        that appears to be the sender to ask if they actually did send you that
        email message. One short phone call could save you months of ransomware
        or malware remediation and associated costs.
