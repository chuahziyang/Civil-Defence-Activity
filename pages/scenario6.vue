      <h2>
        To maintain the security of your next meeting, our recommendations are
        below:
        <br />1. Password protect your meetings <br />The simplest way to
        prevent unwanted attendees and hijacking is to set a password for your
        meeting. Passwords can be set at the individual meeting, user, group, or
        account level for all sessions. In order to do so, first sign in with
        your account at the Zoom web portal. If you want to set up a password at
        the individual meeting level, head straight over to the "Settings" tab
        and enable "Require a password when scheduling new meetings", which will
        ensure a password will be generated when a meeting is scheduled. All
        participants require the password to join the meeting. Subscription
        holders can also choose to go into "Group Management" to require that
        everyone follows the same password practices.
        <br />
        <br />2. Authenticate users <br />When creating a new event, you should
        choose to only allow signed-in users to participate.
        <br />
        <br />3. Join before host <br />Do not allow others to join a meeting
        before you, as the host, have arrived. You can enforce this setting for
        a group under "Account Settings."
        <br />
        <br />4. Lock down your meeting <br />Once a session has begun, head
        over to the "Manage Participants" tab, click "More," and choose to
        "lock" your meeting as soon as every expected participant has arrived.
        This will prevent others from joining even if meeting IDs or access
        details have been leaked.
        <br />
        <br />5. Turn off participant screen sharing <br />No-one wants to see
        pornographic material shared by a Zoom bomber, and so disabling the
        ability for meeting attendees to share their screens is worthwhile. This
        option can be accessed from the new "Security" tab in active sessions.
        <br />
        <br />6. Use a randomly-generated ID <br />You should not use your
        personal meeting ID if possible, as this could pave the way for
        pranksters or attackers that know it to disrupt online sessions.
        Instead, choose a randomly generated ID for meetings when creating a new
        event. In addition, you should not share your personal ID publicly.
        <br />
        <br />7. Use waiting rooms <br />The Waiting Room feature is a way to
        screen participants before they are allowed to enter a meeting. While
        legitimately useful for purposes including interviews or virtual office
        hours, this also gives hosts greater control over session security.
        <br />
        <br />8. Avoid file sharing <br />Be careful with the file-sharing
        feature of meetings, especially if users that you don't recognize are
        sending content across, as it may be malicious. Instead, share material
        using a trusted service such as Box or Google Drive. At the time of
        writing, Zoom has disabled this feature anyway due to a "potential
        security vulnerability."
        <br />
        <br />9. Remove nuisance attendees <br />If you find that someone is
        disrupting a meeting, you can kick them out under the "Participants"
        tab. Hover over the name, click "More," and remove them. You can also
        make sure they cannot rejoin by disabling "Allow Removed Participants to
        Rejoin" under the "Settings: Meetings - Basic" tab.
        <br />
        <br />10. Check for updates <br />
        As security issues crop up and patches are deployed or functions are
        disabled, you should make sure you have the latest build. In order to
        check, open the desktop application, click on your profile in the
        top-right, and select "Check for updates."
